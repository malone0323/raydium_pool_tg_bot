`npm run track -- --pool YOUR_POOL_ADDRESS`
`npm run watch -- --pool YOUR_POOL_ADDRESS`

# Usage
```bash
To get started:

First, edit the .env file and replace YourPoolAddressHere with the Raydium pool address you want to track
Run npm install to install dependencies
Use any of the commands above to start tracking
The script will now:

Show all the token information you requested
Update automatically in watch mode
Be easier to configure through the .env file
Handle errors more gracefully
You can still use the PHP integration as before - it will work with whatever pool address you configure.
